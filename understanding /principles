Key Features:

3 IR Sensors: Left (i1), Center (i2), and Right (i3) detect the black line
L293D Motor Driver: Controls two DC motors independently with speed control
Line Following Logic: 7 different scenarios handled (forward, left turn, right turn, sharp turns, etc.)

How it works:

Sensors read LOW when detecting a black line, HIGH on white surface
When the center sensor detects the line, the robot moves forward
When left/right sensors detect the line, the robot turns accordingly
The robot stops if it loses the line completely

L298N Specific Features:

Better Speed Control: L298N has dedicated Enable pins (ENA and ENB) for precise PWM speed control on each motor independently
Enhanced Turning Functions:

turnLeft() and turnRight() now accept speed parameters for both motors
sharpLeft() and sharpRight() use motor reversal for tighter turns
Added pivotLeft() and pivotRight() for spinning in place


Pin Configuration:

ENA (pin 9): Controls Motor A speed via PWM
ENB (pin 10): Controls Motor B speed via PWM
IN1-IN4: Control motor direction


Adjustable Speed Levels:

SPEED_MAX: 255 (full power)
SPEED_FAST: 200 (normal operation)
SPEED_TURN: 120 (during turns)
SPEED_SLOW: 80 (sharp maneuvers)



L298N Wiring:

Connect Arduino pins 5,6,9 to L298N's IN1, IN2, ENA
Connect Arduino pins 7,8,10 to L298N's IN3, IN4, ENB
Make sure to connect the L298N's 12V input and ground properly

The L298N provides better torque and more precise speed control compared to the L293D!RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
