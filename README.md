# line-follower-robot-pid-control
A simple and efficient Line Follower Robot built using 3 IR reflective sensors, an Arduino, and L298N motor driver. The robot detects the contrast between the black line and the white surface using left, center, and right IR sensors, and adjusts motor speed/direction to follow the path accurately.
